### What do you think is one of the most common problems that customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?


### The predominant issues fall into two categories:

1.  **Deployment and Runtime Errors.**
 Which I have myself encountered.  
 Many of the issues revolve around problems encountered during deployment, runtime errors, and compatibility issues with different frameworks and libraries. These issues can disrupt the smooth deployment and functioning of applications on Vercel.

2.  ** Documentation and Configuration.**
 Another common set of issues relates to documentation, configuration, and project setup. Users often encounter difficulties in understanding and configuring their projects correctly, leading to problems in the deployment process.
In conclusion, most of the common issues are usually linked to the deployment process.
