### How could we improve or alter this familiarization exercise?

In my experience with the familiarization exercise, I found that the instructions provided in the 'Getting Setup' part were not as straightforward as I had hoped.

 Instead of helping me achieve the deployment, I ended up spending more time trying to follow them. As a suggestion for improvement, it might be beneficial to include a quicker and more straightforward method for setting up the environment on Vercel for deployment. 
 
 Since this is a written exercise, simplifying the setup process would allow participants to focus more on the core objectives of the exercise, rather than getting stuck in the initial setup phase.

 This would enhance the overall learning experience and make it more efficient for participants.
