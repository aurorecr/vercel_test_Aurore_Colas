### The customer from question 5 replies to your response with the below:
### “I’m so frustrated. I’ve been trying to make this work for hours and I just can’t figure it out. It must be a platform issue so why don't you just fix it for me instead of asking me questions.”


I'll begin by acknowledging and understanding the client's frustration, assuring them that I'm committed to investigating further. I'll then inquire about their reasoning behind suspecting a platform issue, potentially requesting screenshots or any specific insights they may have gained about the problem.


If applicable, I'll propose a temporary workaround. Meanwhile, I'll conduct research, reviewing previous tickets and investigating the newly pointed issue. I'll update an existing Jira ticket if one exists or create a new one if necessary.


Throughout this process, I'll maintain regular communication to keep the client informed of our progress. Once a potential solution is identified, I'll test it on my end and ask the client to do the same, ensuring their satisfaction with the resolution.
