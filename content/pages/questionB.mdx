Dear client,
I hope you are well,
Thank you for reaching out to the support team.
I understand that you want to redirect a /blog path to another website on Vercel.
To do so it is possible to use either a next.config.js configuration file for Next.js projects or a vercel.json configuration file for all other use cases.


## Next.js Redirects

```module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
   "source": "/blog",
  "destination": "https://newwebsite.com",
  "permanent": true
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

## Other Redirects

```{
  "redirects": [
    { 
 "source": "/blog",
  "destination": "https://newwebsite.com",
  "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

In this configuration, `"source"` represents the path you want to redirect (`/blog`), `"destination"` is the URL of the website you want to redirect to (`https://example.com`), and `"permanent": true` specifies that this is a permanent redirect.
From that you can deploy your project on Vercel for the redirection to take effect.
Your `/blog` path will now be permanently redirected to `https://example.com`.

For more information on setting up redirects on Vercel, please follow the below link:
