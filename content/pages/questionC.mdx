### Please write a reply to the customer. Separately, list any relevant documentation you found and any feedback or information youâ€™d like to share about your decision-making process.

Dear client,


I hope you are well,


Thank you for reaching out to the support team.
By default, Vercel ensures that your project is not indexed by search engines. This is achieved through the X-Robots-Tag HTTP header, which is set to 'noindex' for Vercel Preview Deployments. This instructs search engines not to index the content.
If you are using a Custom Domain for your non-Production Branch, the 'X-Robots-Tag: noindex' header is not set automatically. In such cases, you can manually set this header to maintain the default behavior of preventing indexing.
If you wish to change this behavior and allow search engines to index your Preview Deployments. 
To override the default behavior, please follow the steps on the below page: 
[Are Vercel Preview Deployments indexed by search engines?](https://vercel.com/guides/are-vercel-preview-deployment-indexed-by-search-engines)

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, we are here to assist you,


Best regards,
Aurore
