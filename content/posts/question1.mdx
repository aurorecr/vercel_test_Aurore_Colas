I aim to leverage my knowledge gained since transitioning to a career in technology and thrive in this field. 


My specific passion lies in technologies like React. I also wish to continue to explore backend tools such as Node.js.


My experience gained during my Full Stack Developer training and as a Customer Support Engineer has provided me with substantial problem-solving skills and a strong technical foundation. 
I find great satisfaction in tackling and resolving underlying issues, leveraging my expertise.


Furthermore, I aim to focus on certain product areas so I can give useful advice and solutions.
