### Edge Middleware
“Edge Middleware is code that executes before a request is processed on a site”. 
It can be used when the goal is to modify responses and requests at the edge before they're cached. It's great for personalizing statically generated content based on incoming requests.


### Edge Functions
“Vercel's Edge Functions enable you to deliver dynamic, personalized content with the lightweight Edge Runtime.”
This will be chosen for delivering dynamic, personalized content with short latency. 

It's ideal for fast network interactions such as OAuth callbacks, responding to webhook requests, or interacting with an API that fails if a request is not completed within a short time limit.


### Serverless Functions
“Vercel Serverless Functions enable running code on-demand without needing to manage your own infrastructure, provision servers, or upgrade hardware.”

It’s perfect for handling server-side tasks like user authentication, form submissions, database queries, or complex backend operations. They will automatically scale with traffic and are versatile for various tasks.

The choice to pick one or the other should match the project's specific needs, whether that's changing content, delivering it quickly, or efficiently handling server tasks
