I will compare Next.js and Express.js. The both have distinct roles in web development:

  - Next.js is mainly used for creating the parts of a website that users see and interact with. 
  It's good at making web pages load fast and work well.
  Next.js specializes in creating server-rendered React applications for dynamic user interfaces.


  - Express.js, on the other hand, is used for the behind-the-scenes purpose that makes a website run, such as handling data and requests from users. Itâ€™s designed for web app and API development.
Next.js excels in optimizing the user experience, combining aesthetic appeal with efficient functionality, while Express.js specializes in managing the technical infrastructure that powers the website. 

Frequently, these two frameworks are utilized in tandem to construct a comprehensive and high-performing website.
