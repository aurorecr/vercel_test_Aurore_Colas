### Situation
In my role as Customer Support at Booking.com, I encountered a multifaceted challenge involving customer dissatisfaction with their accommodations, specifically pertaining to requests for free cancellations post check-in.

The customer was dissatisfied with the accommodation so they contacted Booking.com for a free cancellation request after check-in. 
However, in for this booking, the cancellation policy was 30% of the total booking plus a night's stay.

For a full refund or compensation, Booking.com needed proof from the customer such as pictures or video, or written proofs between the accommodation and the customer. 

However, the guests left without pictures, they left the keys inside the accommodation so that they couldnâ€™t return. The partner was reluctant to cancel for no valid reason but asked if it was possible to remove the client's feedback if it was negative. 

Both partner and guest were angry and uncooperative.

### Solution

I successfully persuaded the partner to grant a free cancellation for several reasons.

First, I clarified that feedback could only be removed if it violated platform guidelines.
Secondly, I explained that if the booking was canceled, the guest couldn't leave feedback. Moreover, I emphasized that, given the circumstances, the relatively low cancellation fees did not outweigh the negative impact of a bad review. 
Ultimately, a free cancellation emerged as the most suitable solution to alleviate stress for all parties involved.

### Outcome
Partner eventually agreed to cancel free of charge. 

As a result, both parties were relieved.
