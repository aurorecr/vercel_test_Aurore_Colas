    - Determine which framework or technology is being used.

2.  **Review internal documentation:**
    - Look up official documentation and online resources to understand the basics.
    - Search for any existing support tickets related to the same topic or a corresponding Jira ticket.

3.  **Check Environment and errors:**
    - Ensure the customer's development environment is set up correctly.
    - Analyze error logs or messages for clues.

4.  **Recreate the Issue::**
    -  Try to replicate the problem on my own system if possible.

5.  **Seek Help from Colleagues:**

6.  **Communicate with the client:**
    -  I'll ensure that I provide regular updates to the customer throughout the process. 
    -  If it becomes necessary to create a Jira ticket and wait for the engineering team's response, I'll keep them informed.

7.  **Share the solutions:**
    -  Test the solutions I found on my side.
    -  After identifying potential solutions based on my analysis, I'll recommend them to the client.
